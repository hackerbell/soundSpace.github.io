# Some noticings I have found while working...

1. When making changes, it takes around 2-3 minutes to update in the main website.
2. Specify the file that you're using such as: using .html and .css at end of file.

To link a css file to html use this code (I keep forgetting lolz)
		<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
